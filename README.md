# Hand-Tracking-App
This Python application uses a webcam to capture live video and detects hands using MediaPipeâ€™s Hands solution. It identifies up to two hands, detects their landmarks (21 key points per hand), and visualizes the result by drawing hand connections and landmarks on the video feed.
